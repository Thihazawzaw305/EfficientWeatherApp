# Efficient Weather App

## Overview

**Efficient Weather App** is an Android application designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for a given location. Users can view the current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast using data fetched from a public API. The app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, prioritizing user experience and performance.

## Features

- **Current Weather and 5-Day Forecast:** Users can enter a location (city or coordinates) to view the current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features a clean and intuitive design with appropriate use of UI components like labels, images, and icons.
- **Error Handling:** The app handles network issues and invalid user input gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **API Integration:** Weather data is fetched from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) using asynchronous programming techniques to maintain a responsive UI.
- **Offline Functionality:** Users can view previously fetched weather data even without an internet connection.
- **Modular Code Design:** The app is designed to be easily extensible, making it simple to add new features or make changes in the future.

## Bonus Features

- **Unit Tests:** Implemented unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components.
- **Animations:** Added animations and transitions to enhance the user interface.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Implemented support for dark mode, offering a better user experience in low-light environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio 4.0 or later
- Android device or emulator running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or later
- Internet connection for fetching weather data

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thihazawzaw305/EfficientWeatherApp
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Obtain an API key from the weather API service you're using (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) and add it to your project's configuration.

### Running the App

1. Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
2. Build and run the app from Android Studio.
3. Enter a location (city name or coordinates) to view the current weather and forecast.

## Code Quality and Architecture

- **Clean Code Practices:** The code is written following best practices, including proper error handling, avoiding force unwrapping, and minimizing force casts.
- **Design Patterns:** The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and enhance code maintainability.
- **Comments and Documentation:** Key sections of the code are documented to explain complex logic or algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **`ui/`**: Contains the UI components and layout files.
- **`viewmodel/`**: Holds the ViewModel classes, managing UI-related data.
- **`repository/`**: Interfaces with the API and handles data operations.
- **`network/`**: Manages API calls and network operations.
- **`model/`**: Contains data classes representing the API response models.
- **`util/`**: Utility classes and helpers.

## API Integration

- The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) (or any other chosen API) to fetch weather data.
- Asynchronous programming is utilized (e.g., Kotlin Coroutines) to ensure the UI remains responsive during data fetching.

## Offline Functionality

- Weather data is cached locally to allow users to view previously fetched information even when offline.

## Testing

- Unit tests are implemented to validate critical functionality.
- To run the tests:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew test
    ```

## Additional Features

- **Animations:** UI transitions and animations are added to enhance user interaction.
- **Dark Mode Support:** The app adapts to the system's dark mode setting for a better user experience in low-light conditions.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more detailed weather data, such as hourly forecasts.
- Integrating location services to automatically fetch the weather for the user's current location.
- Implementing weather alerts for severe conditions.
